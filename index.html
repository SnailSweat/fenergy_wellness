        <div class="testimonial-carousel">
            <div class="testimonial-slide"> <div class="testimonial-item"> <p>"Fen is a truly gifted healer who is continuously expanding his repertoire of knowledge and applying it in his practice. From the moment I met Fen, I knew I was in good hands - he has a gentle and attentive way about him and will always listen, without judgment, to all of your concerns with the aim of restoring balance to the body as a whole. His clinic is clean, warm and welcoming, and is a safe space for patients of all walks of life. As an osteopath, he was able to address my seasonal allergies via lymphatic massage. They have improved so much that I no longer have to take antihistamines on a daily basis! I was skeptical, but there really is something to it. I would wholeheartedly recommend Fen and wish him all best on his lifelong journey as a healthcare and wellness practitioner."</p>

            <div class="testimonial-slide"> <div class="testimonial-item"> <p>"My osteopathy and massage appointment with Fen went really well. I was pleasantly surprised by how efficient yet painless the service was. I got help with my hips alignment, ankle movement range and overall strength and flexibility. I immediately felt better after the appointment. Fen is friendly, welcoming, professional and good at explaining things. The wellness centre space is clean, warm and relaxing. I highly recommend Fen for massage and osteopathy."</p>
